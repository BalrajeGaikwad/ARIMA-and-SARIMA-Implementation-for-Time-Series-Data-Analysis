📈 Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA & SARIMA
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting time series data using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) models. The goal is to apply statistical modeling techniques to gain insights from historical data and accurately predict future values.

🔍 Project Objectives
Visualize and understand the structure of the time series.
Test for stationarity and apply necessary transformations.
Build and evaluate ARIMA and SARIMA models.
Forecast future values and compare results.
Plot ACF and PACF to determine ARIMA parameters.
